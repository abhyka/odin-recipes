        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground beef (80 - 85% lean) and ground pork -</strong> don't use previously frozen or meat won't hold together as well and they won't taste as fresh.</li>

            <li><strong>Fresh bread crumbs -</strong> made from hearty, dense bread such as a la brea loaf (not a fluffy loaf of french bread or sandwich bread). The hearty stuff is more absorbent. Preferably use 2 or 3 day old stale bread.</li>

            <li><strong>Fresh herbs (basil, parsley and oregano) -</strong> highly recommend sticking with the fresh herbs but if you don't have them on hand dried will work in a pinch (use 2 tsp dried basil, 2 tsp dried parsley and 1 tsp dried oregano). But the next time do try them with fresh it really does make a difference in flavor.</li>

            <li><strong>Fresh onion and garlic -</strong> normally I'm all about saut√©ing these aromatics first, but to save time we finely mince the onion to the size of minced garlic so it isn't crunchy by the time the meatballs are done.</li>

            <li><strong>Eggs -</strong> these will hold the meatballs together. Don't skip them.</li>

            <li><strong>Whole milk -</strong> this keeps the meatballs moist. No one wants to eat dry meatballs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Tear up slices of hearty bread (2 or 3 days old) into pieces.</li>

            <li>Place in a food processor and blitz to fine crumbs.</li>

            <li>Some recipes call for toasted fresh breadcrumbs but here we use fresh. If you need to toast them for a different recipe spread on a rimmed 18 by 13-inch baking sheet and bake in a 300 degree oven until dried, tossing occasionally, about 10 - 15 minutes. Let cool.</li>

            <li>Store leftover, fresh or toasted crumbs, in an airtight container in the freezer for longer shelf life (up to 3 months).</li>
        </ol>
