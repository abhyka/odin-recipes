        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A chicken noodle soup recipe that's a very easy, very good substitute for when you don't have time to make your soup totally from scratch.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Onions and Celery:</strong> In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.</li>

            <li><strong>Broth:</strong> This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</li>

            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</li>

            <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</li>

            <li><strong>Carrots:</strong> Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.</li>

            <li><strong>Basil and Oregano:</strong> Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add chicken broth, vegetable broth, chicken, egg noodles, carrots, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.</li>

            <li>Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
